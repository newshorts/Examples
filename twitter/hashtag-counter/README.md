How to use this:
================

This twitter tracker opens a stream (streaming api) and tracks a single hashtag. If it receives a new tweet, it checks the database for existing tweets and stores/disregards the tweet appropriately.

A working example can be found at the BribeTheSenateTwitterTracker app on heroku.
